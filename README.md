# CPU Performance Comparison of Various Loops in Python

## Project Overview
This project compares the performance of different loop structures in Python, focusing on their efficiency in terms of execution time. The comparison includes various types of loops, such as `for`, `while`, and `list comprehensions`.

## What I Have Done
- **Implemented Different Loop Types**: Created Python code to test the performance of `for` loops, `while` loops, and list comprehensions.
- **Performance Measurement**: Used Python's `time` module to measure and compare the execution time of each loop structure.
- **Results Analysis**: Analyzed the execution time to determine the most efficient loop structure in Python for different scenarios.

## Results
The project provides insights into the efficiency of different loop structures in Python, helping developers choose the most optimal loop based on their specific use case.
